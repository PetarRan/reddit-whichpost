## 🛠️ How It Works (Powered by Devvit)

WhichPost is built on **Reddit's Devvit platform**, a framework that lets developers create **native apps for Reddit**—think bots, games, and interactive widgets that run **inside** Reddit itself. 🛠️ 

### 🔗 Hosted Directly on Reddit
Since Devvit apps **run within Reddit**, you **don’t need a separate server**! The game:
1. **Fetches top posts** from popular subreddits.
2. **Displays two posts** for users to guess between.
3. **Tracks scores & leaderboards** using Reddit’s backend.
4. **Runs directly on Reddit**, meaning no external hosting hassles!
